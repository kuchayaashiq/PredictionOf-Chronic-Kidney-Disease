# Prediction-Of-CKD-using-ML-Algorithms
As we all know in today’s world one in every 5 persons suffers from some sort of chronic disease. Chronic diseases require ongoing medical
attention or limit activities of daily living or both. Sooner the disease is predicted for a person easier his/her life can become by the
modification of his/her living-style. For our project we have taken one such chronic disease "Kidney disease" with thehelp of machine learning algorithms.
we will try to predict the various aspects of the above-mentioned disorders.
Aims:
➢ Prediction of Chronic Kidney Disease
The aim of this project is to build a model which will predict whether a patient has Chronic Kidney Disease or not based on his/her medical data. 
We will do the same by implementing machine learning algorithms on the dataset. We will implement more than one
algorithm on the dataset to find the best suitable algorithm based on the accuracy.


Conclusion:
Machine learning algorithms have shown good classification performance on our project
“Prediction of Chronic Kidney Disease using Machine Learning Algorithms”. The algorithms
that we used, work on existing data to gather information in order to predict. That‘s why machinelearning methods are not as widely used as one might expect. We argue that our model can at least
partially be attributed to uncertainties regarding the diagnosis of Chronic Kidney Disease. The
experimental results can assist healthcare personals to make early decisions to protect a person
from Chronic Kidney Disease and if a person has chronic Kidney disease, it will help them to curb
this disease so that it won't advance to other stages which will in turn help them to reduce the
number of Kidney failures due to CKD. The main aim of this project was to design and implement
a model that will make prediction about whether a patient has Chronic Kidney Disease or not
using machine learning algorithms on a relevant dataset.
By using a Machine Learning Technique called Feature Selection, we came to theconclusion that
among 24 attributes, the top 10 attributes which contribute to/affect our decision the most are:
1. White Blood Cell Count
2. Blood Glucose Random
3. Blood Urea
4. Serum Creatinine
5. Packed Cell Volume
6. Albumin
7. Hemoglobin
8. Age
9. Sugar
10.Hypertension
These 10 attributes are the most important parameters among all the 24 attributes for the
prediction of Chronic Kidney Disease according to the dataset and our research.63
Since our project was classification based, so we implemented seven classifications on our
dataset. We implemented Decision Tree Classifier, K-Nearest Neighbour, Support Vector
Classifier, Ada Boost Classifier, Gaussian Naïve bayes, Random Forest classifier and Logistics
regression classification algorithms. Among these seven algorithms, Random Forest Classifier,
Ada Boost and Decision Tree have the highest accuracy of 97% approximately. The KNN, SVM,
Ada Boost, GNB, Decision Tree, Random Forest and Logistics Regression have accuracy of 78%,
74%, 97%, 93%, 97%, 97%, 95% respectively. The different performance measures that are
being compared are Accuracy, F1-score, Precision and Recall.
